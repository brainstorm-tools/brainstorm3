The OpenMEEG software is a C++ package for solving the forward
problems of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG).

OpenMEEG is distributed under the French opensource license CeCILL-B. It is
intended to give users the freedom to modify and redistribute the software.
It is therefore compatible with popular opensource licenses such as the GPL

software incorporating OpenMEEG the obligation to give credits (by citing the
appropriate publications), in order for all contributions to be properly
identified and acknowledged.
