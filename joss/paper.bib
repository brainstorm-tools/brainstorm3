               subdividing the human cerebral cortex on magnetic resonance

               dataset of 40 MRI scans we manually identified 34 cortical ROIs
               in each of the individual hemispheres. This information was then
               encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to
               automatically label ROIs. To examine the validity, as well as the
               intra- and inter-rater reliability of the automated system, we
               used both intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and a new
               method known as mean distance maps, to assess the degree of
               mismatch between the manual and the automated sets of ROIs. When
               compared with the manual ROIs, the automated ROIs were highly
               accurate, with an average ICC of 0.835 across all of the ROIs,
               and a mean distance error of less than 1 mm. Intra- and
               inter-rater comparisons yielded little to no difference between

               requires multimodal approaches that combine data from various
               neuroimaging techniques. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy
               (fNIRS) offers valuable insights into hemodynamic responses,
               complementing other modalities such as electroencephalography
               (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and magnetic resonance
               imaging. However, there is a lack of comprehensive and accessible
               toolboxes able to integrate fNIRS advanced analyses with other
               modalities. NIRSTORM addresses this gap by offering a unified
               platform for multimodal neuroimaging analysis. Aim: NIRSTORM aims
               to provide a user-friendly and comprehensive environment for
               multimodal analysis while supporting the entire fNIRS analysis
               pipeline, from experiment planning to the reconstruction of
               hemodynamic fluctuations on the cortex. Approach: Developed in
               MATLAB®, NIRSTORM operates as a Brainstorm plugin, enhancing
               Brainstorm's capabilities for analyzing fNIRS data. Brainstorm is
               a widely used, GUI-based software originally designed for
               statistical analysis and source imaging of EEG and MEG data.
               Results: NIRSTORM supports conventional fNIRS preprocessing and
               statistical analyses while introducing new advanced features such
               as optimal montage for planning optode placement and maximum
               entropy on the mean (MEM) for reconstructing hemodynamic
               fluctuations on the cortical surface. Conclusion: As an

               epilepsy and for interpreting effects from cognitive studies
               employing intracranial electroencephalography. Localization is
               typically performed by coregistering postimplant computed
               tomography (CT) with preoperative magnetic resonance imaging
               (MRI). Electrodes are then detected in the CT, and the
               corresponding brain region is identified using the MRI. Many
               existing software packages for electrode localization chain
               together separate preexisting programs or rely on command line
               instructions to perform the various localization steps, making
               them difficult to install and operate for a typical user.
               Further, many packages provide solutions for some, but not all,
               of the steps needed for confident localization. We have developed
               software, Locate electrodes Graphical User Interface (LeGUI),
               that consists of a single interface to perform all steps needed
               to localize both surface and depth/penetrating intracranial
               electrodes, including coregistration of the CT to MRI,
               normalization of the MRI to the Montreal Neurological Institute
               template, automated electrode detection for multiple types of
               electrodes, electrode spacing correction and projection to the

               software is written in MATLAB, core image processing is performed
               using the Statistical Parametric Mapping toolbox, and standalone
               executable binaries are available for Windows, Mac, and Linux
               platforms. LeGUI was tested and validated on 51 datasets from two
               universities. The total user and computational time required to
               process a single dataset was approximately 1 h. Automatic
               electrode detection correctly identified 4362 of 4695 surface and
               depth electrodes with only 71 false positives. Anatomical
               targeting was verified by comparing electrode locations from
               LeGUI to locations that were assigned by an experienced
               neuroanatomist. LeGUI showed a 94\% match with the 482
               neuroanatomist-assigned locations. LeGUI combines all the
               features needed for fast and accurate anatomical localization of

               drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) patients being evaluated for
               neurosurgery. After implantation of SEEG electrodes, it is
               important to determine the neuroanatomic locations of electrode
               contacts (ECs), to localize ictal onset and propagation, and
               integrate functional information to facilitate surgical
               decisions. Although there are tools for coregistration of
               preoperative MRI and postoperative CT scans, identification,
               sorting, and labeling of SEEG ECs is often performed manually,
               which is resource intensive. We report development and validation
               of a software named Fast Automated SEEG Electrode Contact
               Identification and Labeling Ensemble (FASCILE). METHODS: FASCILE
               is written in Python 3.8.3 and employs a novel automated method
               for identifying ECs, assigning them to respected SEEG electrodes,
               and labeling. We compared FASCILE with our clinical process of
               identifying, sorting, and labeling ECs, by computing localization
               error in anteroposterior, superoinferior, and lateral dimensions.
               We also measured mean Euclidean distances between ECs identified
               by FASCILE and the clinical method. We compared time taken for EC
               identification, sorting, and labeling for the software developer
               using FASCILE, a first-time clinical user using FASCILE, and the
               conventional clinical process. RESULTS: Validation in 35
               consecutive DRE patients showed a mean overall localization error
               of 0.73 ± 0.15 mm. FASCILE required 10.7 ± 5.5 min/patient for
               identifying, sorting, and labeling ECs by a first-time clinical
               user, compared to 3.3 ± 0.7 h/patient required for the
               conventional clinical process. CONCLUSION: Given the accuracy,
               speed, and ease of use, we expect FASCILE to be used frequently
               for SEEG-driven epilepsy surgery. It is freely available for
               noncommercial use. FASCILE is specifically designed to expedite

               widely used to explore the epileptic network and localize the
               epileptic zone in patients with medically intractable epilepsy.
               Accurate anatomical labeling of SEEG electrode contacts is
               critically important for correctly interpreting epileptic
               activity. We present a method for automatically assigning
               anatomical labels to SEEG electrode contacts using a 3D-segmented
               cortex and coregistered postoperative CT images. METHOD:
               Stereotactic electroencephalography electrode contacts were
               spatially localized relative to the brain volume using a standard
               clinical procedure. Each contact was then assigned an anatomical
               label by clinical epilepsy fellows. Separately, each contact was
               automatically labeled by coregistering the subject's MRI to the
               USCBrain atlas using the BrainSuite software and assigning labels
               from the atlas based on contact locations. The results of both
               labeling methods were then compared, and a subsequent vetting of
               the anatomical labels was performed by expert review. RESULTS:
               Anatomical labeling agreement between the two methods for over 17
               000 SEEG contacts was 82\%. This agreement was consistent in
               patients with and without previous surgery (P = .852). Expert
               review of contacts in disagreement between the two methods
               resulted in agreement with the atlas based over manual labels in
               48\% of cases, agreement with manual over atlas-based labels in
               36\% of cases, and disagreement with both methods in 16\% of
               cases. Labels deemed incorrect by the expert review were then
               categorized as either in a region directly adjacent to the
               correct label or as a gross error, revealing a lower likelihood
               of gross error from the automated method. SIGNIFICANCE: The
               method for semi-automated atlas-based anatomical labeling we
               describe here demonstrates potential to assist clinical workflow
               by reducing both analysis time and the likelihood of gross
               anatomical error. Additionally, it provides a convenient means of
               intersubject analysis by standardizing the anatomical labels
               applied to SEEG contact locations across subjects.",

               (SEEG) signals, the physicist's workflow involves several
               operations, including determining the position of individual
               electrode contacts in terms of both relationship to grey or white
               matter and location in specific brain regions. These operations
               are (i) generally carried out manually by experts with limited
               computer support, (ii) hugely time consuming, and (iii) often
               inaccurate, incomplete, and prone to errors. RESULTS: In this
               paper we present SEEG Assistant, a set of tools integrated in a
               single 3DSlicer extension, which aims to assist neurosurgeons in
               the analysis of post-implant structural data and hence aid the
               neurophysiologist in the interpretation of SEEG data. SEEG
               Assistant consists of (i) a module to localize the electrode
               contact positions using imaging data from a thresholded
               post-implant CT, (ii) a module to determine the most probable
               cerebral location of the recorded activity, and (iii) a module to
               compute the Grey Matter Proximity Index, i.e. the distance of
               each contact from the cerebral cortex, in order to discriminate
               between white and grey matter location of contacts. Finally,
               exploiting 3DSlicer capabilities, SEEG Assistant offers a
               Graphical User Interface that simplifies the interaction between
               the user and the tools. SEEG Assistant has been tested on 40
               patients segmenting 555 electrodes, and it has been used to
               identify the neuroanatomical loci and to compute the distance to
               the nearest cerebral cortex for 9626 contacts. We also performed
               manual segmentation and compared the results between the proposed
               tool and gold-standard clinical practice. As a result, the use of
               SEEG Assistant decreases the post implant processing time by more
               than 2 orders of magnitude, improves the quality of results and
               decreases, if not eliminates, errors in post implant processing.
               CONCLUSIONS: The SEEG Assistant Framework for the first time
               supports physicists by providing a set of open-source tools for
               post-implant processing of SEEG data. Furthermore, SEEG Assistant
               has been integrated into 3D Slicer, a software platform for the
               analysis and visualization of medical images, overcoming
               limitations of command-line tools.",

               promise the emergence of population neuroscience. The
               considerable diversity in personality traits and behaviour
               between individuals is reflected in the statistical variability
               of neural data collected in such repositories. Recent studies
               with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have concluded
               that patterns of resting-state functional connectivity can both
               successfully distinguish individual participants within a cohort
               and predict some individual traits, yielding the notion of an
               individual's neural fingerprint. Here, we aim to clarify the
               neurophysiological foundations of individual differentiation from
               features of the rich and complex dynamics of resting-state brain
               activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 158 participants.
               We show that akin to fMRI approaches, neurophysiological
               functional connectomes enable the differentiation of individuals,
               with rates similar to those seen with fMRI. We also show that
               individual differentiation is equally successful from simpler
               measures of the spatial distribution of neurophysiological
               spectral signal power. Our data further indicate that
               differentiation can be achieved from brain recordings as short as
               30 seconds, and that it is robust over time: the neural
               fingerprint is present in recordings performed weeks after their
               baseline reference data was collected. This work, thus, extends
               the notion of a neural or brain fingerprint to fast and
               large-scale resting-state electrophysiological dynamics.",

               electrodes can be needed to precisely define the epileptogenic
               zone. Accurate location of these electrodes is thus essential for
               the interpretation of Stereotaxic EEG (SEEG) signals. As SEEG
               analysis increasingly relies on signal processing, it is crucial
               to make a link between these results and patient's anatomy. Our
               aims were thus to develop a suite of software tools, called
               ``EpiTools'', able to i) precisely and automatically localize the
               position of each SEEG contact and ii) display the results of
               signal analysis in each patient's anatomy. NEW METHOD: The first
               tool, GARDEL (GUI for Automatic Registration and Depth Electrode
               Localization), is able to automatically localize SEEG contacts
               and to label each contact according to a pre-specified
               nomenclature (for instance that of FreeSurfer or MarsAtlas). The
               second tool, 3Dviewer, enables to visualize in the 3D anatomy of
               the patient the origin of signal processing results such as rate
               of biomarkers, connectivity graphs or Epileptogenicity Index.
               RESULTS: GARDEL was validated in 30 patients by clinicians and
               proved to be highly reliable to determine within the patient's
               individual anatomy the actual location of contacts. COMPARISON
               WITH EXISTING METHODS: GARDEL is a fully automatic electrode
               localization tool needing limited user interaction (only for
               electrode naming or contact correction). The 3Dviewer is able to
               read signal processing results and to display them in link with
               patient's anatomy. CONCLUSION: EpiTools can help speeding up the
               interpretation of SEEG data and improving its precision.",

               These electrophysiology (e-phys) signals can often be measured

               forward problem involves modeling these signals at their sensors
               for a given equivalent current dipole configuration within the
               brain. While earlier researchers modeled the head as a simple set
               of isotropic spheres, today's magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
               data allow for a detailed anatomic description of brain
               structures and anisotropic characterization of tissue

               is performed by integrating the latest tools for MRI segmentation

               intracerebral electrodes is widely practiced to improve
               pre-surgical seizure onset zone localization in patients with
               medically refractory seizures. Stereo-Electroencephalography
               (SEEG) is mainly used to localize the epileptogenic zone and a
               precise knowledge of the location of the electrodes is expected
               to facilitate the recordings interpretation and the planning of
               resective surgery. However, the localization of intracerebral
               electrodes on post-implant acquisitions is usually time-consuming
               (i.e., manual segmentation), it requires advanced 3D
               visualization tools, and it needs the supervision of trained
               medical doctors in order to minimize the errors. In this paper we
               propose an automated segmentation algorithm specifically designed
               to segment SEEG contacts from a thresholded post-implant
               Cone-Beam CT volume (0.4 mm, 0.4 mm, 0.8 mm). The algorithm
               relies on the planned position of target and entry points for
               each electrode as a first estimation of electrode axis. We
               implemented the proposed algorithm into DEETO, an open source C++
               prototype based on ITK library. RESULTS: We tested our
               implementation on a cohort of 28 subjects in total. The
               experimental analysis, carried out over a subset of 12 subjects
               (35 multilead electrodes; 200 contacts) manually segmented by
               experts, show that the algorithm: (i) is faster than manual
               segmentation (i.e., less than 1s/subject versus a few hours) (ii)
               is reliable, with an error of 0.5 mm ± 0.06 mm, and (iii) it
               accurately maps SEEG implants to their anatomical regions
               improving the interpretability of electrophysiological traces for
               both clinical and research studies. Moreover, using the
               28-subject cohort we show here that the algorithm is also robust
               (error < 0.005 mm) against deep-brain displacements (< 12 mm) of
               the implanted electrode shaft from those planned before surgery.
               CONCLUSIONS: Our method represents, to the best of our knowledge,
               the first automatic algorithm for the segmentation of SEEG
               electrodes. The method can be used to accurately identify the
               neuroanatomical loci of SEEG electrode contacts by a non-expert
               in a fast and reliable manner.",
