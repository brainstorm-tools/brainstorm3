function [ strCommon, cutStrList ] = str_common_path( strList, delimiters )
% STR_COMMON_PATH: Extract the common part in all the input strings.
%
% USAGE:  [ strCommon, cutStrList ] = str_common_path( strList )
%
% INPUTS: 
%     - strList : cell array of path (they must have the same depth)
%     - delimiters : String that contains all the characters used to split, default = '/\'
% OUTPUTS:
%     - strCommon  : common substring 
%     - cutStrList : strList without the common beginning string
