function [x,tracks] = bst_sin_remove(x, fs, Sinusoids)
% Track frequencies with desired RBW: This version directly convolves with the desired frequency.
%
% USAGE: [x,tracks] = bst_sin_remove(x, fs, Sinusoids)
%
% INPUTS:
%     - x    : Signals to process [nChannels x nTime]
%     - fs   : Sampling frequency of the x signal
%     - Sinusoids: Vector of sinusoids to model and extract, returned in tracks 
%
% OUTPUTS:
%     - x      : Filtered signals [nChannels x nTime]
%     - tracks : 3D matrix of frequencies extracted
%
% NOTE: Requires Signal Processing Toolbox
