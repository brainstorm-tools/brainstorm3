function VecInd  = bst_closest(VecGuess, VecRef)
% BST_CLOSEST: Find entries of closest elements between two vectors.
%
% USAGE:  VecInd  = bst_closest(VecGuess, VecRef);
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%     VecGuess is a vector for which one wants to find the closest entries in vector VecRef
%     VecInd is the vector of indices pointing atr the entries in vector VecRef that are the closest to VecWin
%     VecInd is of the length of VecGuess
% 
%     In other words, VecRef(VecInd(i)) is the element of VecRef closest to VecGuess(j)
% 
%     VecRef and VecGuess do not need to be the same length
