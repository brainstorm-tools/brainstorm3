function p = bst_cross(x,y,dim)
% BST_CROSS: Cross product between two sets, each set with three columns
% 
% USAGE:  p = bst_cross(x,y)
%         p = bst_cross(x,y,dim)
%
% INPUT:
%     - x   : [1,3] double or single
%     - y   : [1,3] double or single
%     - dim : dimension along which to compute the cross product
%
% NOTE:
%     - Does exactly then same as the Matlab 'cross' function, but much faster.
