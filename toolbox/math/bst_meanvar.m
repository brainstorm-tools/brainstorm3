function varargout = bst_meanvar(varargin)
%BST_MEANVAR: Mex-file to compute mean and variance along first dimension (with imprecise algorithm)
%
% USAGE: [mean,var,nAvg] = bst_meanvar(x, isZeroBad)
% 
% INPUTS: 
%    - x         : [NxM] double matrix with values to process
%    - isZeroBad : If 1, excludes all the zero values from the computation
%
% OUTPUTS:
%    - mean : [1xM] averages values 
%    - var  : [1xM] unbiased estimator of the variance (computed with an algorithm prone to rounding errors)
%    - nAvg : [1xM] number of non-zero values that were averaged
% 
% COMPILE:
%    mex -v bst_meanvar.c
