function Wmat = bst_shepards(destLoc, srcLoc, nbNeighbors, excludeParam, expDistance)
% BST_SHEPARDS: 3D nearest-neighbor interpolation using Shepard's weighting.
%
% USAGE:  Wmat = bst_shepards(destLoc, srcLoc, nbNeighbors=8, excludeParam=0, expDistance=2)
%
% INPUT:
%    - srcLoc       : Nx3 array of original locations, or tesselation structure (Faces,Vertices,VertConn)
%    - destLoc      : NNx3 array of locations onto original data will be interpolated, or tesselation structure (Faces,Vertices,VertConn)
%    - nbNeighbors  : Number of nearest neighbors to be considered in the interpolation (default is 8)
%    - excludeParam : If > 0, the source points that are two far away from the destination surface are ignored.
%                     Excluded points #i that have: (minDist(i) > mean(minDist) + excludeParam * std(minDist))
%                     where minDist represents the minimal distance between each source point and the destination surface
%                     If < 0, exclude the vertices that are further from the absolute distance excludeParam  (in millimeters)
%    - expDistance  : Distance exponent (if higher, influence of a value decreases faster)
%    
% OUTPUT:
%    - Wmat : Interpolation matrix
