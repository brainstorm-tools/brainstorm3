function [x,b,a] = bst_bandpass_filtfilt(x, Fs, HighPass, LowPass, isStopBand, FilterType)
% BST_BANDPASS_FILTFILT: Bandpass filter for the signal x, using the filtfilt function (used by default after Nov 2014)
%
% USAGE:  [x,b,a] = bst_bandpass_filtfilt(x, Fs, HighPass, LowPass, isStopBand=0, FilterType='fir')
% 
% INPUT: 
%    - x          : [nChannels,nTime] signal to process
%    - Fs         : Sampling frequency
%    - HighPass   : Frequency below this value are filtered (set to 0 for low-pass filter only)
%    - LowPass    : Frequency above this value are filtered (set to 0 for high-pass filter only)
%    - isStopBand : If 1, create a stop-band filter instead of a pass-band filter
%    - FilterType : 'fir' or 'iir'
%
% OUTPUT:
%    - x   : Filtered signals
%    - b,a : Filter coefficients, as defined in all the Matlab functions
%
% DESCRIPTION: 
%    - A linear phase FIR filter is created and applied both forward and backward using filtfilt.
%    - Function "filtfilt" is used to employ the filtering "mirror" trick, and to reset automatically the group delay.
%    - Function "kaiserord" and "kaiser" are used to set the necessary order for fir1. 
%    - The transition band is hard-coded. 
%    - Requires Signal Processing Toolbox for the following functions: kaiserord, kaiser, ellipord, 
%      If not, using Octave-based alternatives
