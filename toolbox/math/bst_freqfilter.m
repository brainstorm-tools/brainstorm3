% BST_FREQFILTER: Apply a frequency filter to a signal.
%
% INPUTS:
%    - F            : [nSignals x nTime]  Signals to filter
%    - freq_filter  : [nSignals x nFreq]  Filter to apply to the signals
%    - freq_support : [1 x nFreq] List of frequencies, support of freq_filter
%    - F_fft        : Optional, FFT of the signals if already calculated
