function Dist = bst_surfdist(Points, Vertices, Faces)
% BST_SURFDIST: Compute the distances between points and a surface.
%
% USAGE:  Dist = bst_surfdist(Points, Vertices, Faces)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%     Exact distance computation, which checks all 3 sets of distances: points
%     to vertices, points to edges, and points to faces, keeping the smallest
%     for each point.
%
% INPUTS:
%    - Points   : [Qx3] double matrix, points to compare to the mesh defined by Vertices/Faces
%    - Vertices : [Mx3] double matrix
%    - Faces    : [Nx3] double matrix
%
% OUTPUTS:
%    - Dist     : [Qx1] final distance between points and mesh
