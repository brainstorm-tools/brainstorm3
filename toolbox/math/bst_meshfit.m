function [R, T, newP] = bst_meshfit(Vertices, Faces, P)
% BST_MESHFIT: Find the best possible rotation-translation to fit a point cloud on a mesh.
%
% USAGE:  [R, T, newP] = bst_meshfit(Vertices, Faces, P)
%
% DESCRIPTION: 
%     A Gauss-Newton method is used for the optimization of the distance points/mesh.
%     The Gauss-Newton algorithm used here was initially implemented by 
%     Qianqian Fang (fangq at nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) and distributed under a GPL license
%     as part of the Metch toolbox (http://iso2mesh.sf.net, regpt2surf.m).
%
% INPUTS:
%    - Vertices : [Mx3] double matrix
%    - Faces    : [Nx3] double matrix
%    - P        : [Qx3] double matrix, points to fit on the mesh defined by Vertices/Faces
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   R    : [3x3] rotation matrix from the original P to the fitted positions.
%   T    : [3x1] translation vector from the original P to the fitted positions.
%   newP : [Mx3] fitted positions of the points in input matrix P.

% ===== COMPUTE POINTS/MESH DISTANCE =====
% Approximates the distance to the mesh by the projection on the norm vector of the nearest neighbor
function [dist,dt] = get_distance(Vertices, VertNorm, P, dt)
    % Find the nearest neighbor
    [iNearest, dist_pt, dt] = bst_nearest(Vertices, P, 1, 0, dt);
    % Distance = projection of the distance between the point and its nearest 
    % neighbor in the surface on the vertex normal 
    % As the head surface is supposed to be very smooth, it should be a good approximation 
    % of the distance from the point to the surface.
    dist = abs(sum(VertNorm(iNearest,:) .* (P - Vertices(iNearest,:)),2));

% ===== COMPUTE TRANSFORMATION =====
% Gauss-Newton optimization algorithm
% Based on work from Qianqian Fang, 2008

        dist0 = get_distance(Vertices, VertNorm, newP, dt);

        % If global error is going up: stop

            % Calculate the distance for this new transformation

% ===== GET TRANSFORMATION =====
