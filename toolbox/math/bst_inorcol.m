function [normeM] = bst_inorcol(Mat)
% INORCOL: Compute the (pseudo)inverse of the column norms of matrix Mat.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%     normeM is a sparse diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements 
%     are the inverse of the corresponding column norm of matrix Mat.
%     If a column is zero, then its inverse is set to zero as well.
