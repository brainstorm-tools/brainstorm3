function [Lf_cortex, Q_cortex] = bst_xyz2lf(Lf_xyz, normals)
%   This program takes a leadfield matix computed for dipole components
%   pointing in the x, y, and z directions, and outputs a new lead field
%   matrix for dipole components pointing in the normal direction of the 
%   cortical surfaces and in the two tangential directions to the cortex
%   (that is on the tangent cortical space). These two tangential dipole
%   components are uniquely determined by the SVD (reduction of variance).
%
%   Usage: [Lf_cortex,Q_cortex]=bst_xyz2lf(Lf_xyz,normals)
% 
%   Inputs:
%
%   Lf_xyz is the leadfield matrix for the dipoles in the x, y, and z
%   orientations.
%
%   normals is a matrix with cortical surface normals.
%
%   Output:
%
%   Lf_cortex is a leadfield matrix for dipoles in rotated orientations, so
%   that the first column is the gain vector for the cortical normal dipole
%   and the following two column vectors are the gain vectors for the 
%   tangential orientations (tangent space of cortical surface).
%
%   Q_cortex is a matrix with rotated dipole orientations.
