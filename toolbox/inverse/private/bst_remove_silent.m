function [Lnew,Q] = bst_remove_silent(L)
% bst_remove_silent: removes silent component of single sphere head model.
%
% USAGE:  [Lnew,Q]=bst_remove_silent(L)
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%     Removes silent component of single sphere head model.
%
% INPUTS:
%     - L : Forward field matrix for all the channels
%
% OUTPUTS:
%     - Lnew : New forward field matrix for all the channels containg 2/3
%     the number of dipole components. The radial dipole components have
%     been removed, and only the gain vectors produced by the two
%     tangential dipole components are included.
%     - Q: A matrix containg the orientations of the two tangential dipole
%     components per source point.
