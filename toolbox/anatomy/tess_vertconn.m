function VertConn = tess_vertconn(Vertices, Faces)
% TESS_VERTCONN: Computes vertices connectivity.
% 
% INPUT:
%     - Vertices   : Mx3 double matrix
%     - Faces      : Nx3 double matrix
% OUTPUT:
%    - VertConn: Connectivity sparse matrix with dimension nVertices x nVertices. 
%                It has 1 at (i,j) when vertices i and j are connected.
