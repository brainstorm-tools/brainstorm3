function [intersect,indx,t,u,v] = tess_ray_intersect(Vertices, Faces, r, d, cull)
% TESS_RAY_INTERSECT: find intersection of a ray with a set of faces.
%
% USAGE:  [intersect,indx,t,u,v] = tess_ray_intersect(Vertices, Faces, r, d, cull)
%
% INPUT:
%     - Vertices : Mx3 double matrix
%     - Faces    : Nx3 double matrix
%     - r        : Observation point
%     - d        : Unit directional vector (from point r)
%                  (will be automatically scaled to unity in the program)
%     - cull     : One of 'i', 'o', or 'b', for inside (backside), outside (frontside), or both sides.
%
% OUTPUT:
%    - indx  : index such that Faces(INDX,:) gives the triangles intersected.
%    - t,u,v : gives distance t to the point(s) of intersection, with point(s) of intersection given by
%              INTERSECT = (1-U-V) .* Vertices(Faces(indx,1),:) + ...
%                          U .* Vertices(Faces(indx,2),:) + V .* Vertices(Faces(indx,3),:);
%              where U is repmat(u,1,3) and similarly V.
%
% NOTES:
%    - To use in the calculation. Only first letter of CULL is
%      considered, so 'inside', 'outside', or 'both' are acceptable.
%    - For example, 'i' means the ray passes from the observation r in the
%      direction d through the backside and out the frontside of the triangle.
%    - In other words, the observation is inside a closed surface.
%    - Note that the program assumes right-handedness in the faces description,
%      such that V0 to V1 to V2 points "out" or "front."

% ====================================================================
% Uses Tomas Moeller and Ben Trumbore's "Fast, Minimum Storage
%  Ray/Triangle Intersection" 1997approach. Given a line defined by
%  L(t) = R + t * D and a triangle vertex V0 and edges E1 and E2
%  emanating from VO. Then the point of intersection between the
%  ray and the plane defined by the triangle is
%  [-D, E1, E2] [t;u;v] = R - V0;
% If u and v are both 0 <= u,v <= 1, then the intersection
%  is in the bounds of the triangle. The point on the triangle
%  is given by T(u,v) = (1 - u - v)*V0 + u*V1 + v*V2, where
%  E1 = V1 - V0, and E2 = V2 - V0. {u,v} are the barycentric
%  coordinates of the triangle.
% The solution is simply Cramer's rule,
%      [t]   =  {T,E1,E2}   /
%      [u]   =  {-D,T,E2}  /   {-D,E1,E2}.
%      [v]   =  {-D,E1,T} /
%  where T is the translation R - V0, and {a,b,c} is the
%  triple scalar product.
% Moeller and Trumbore's trick is to first cull the set of triangles
%  looking for determinants in the correct direction. In this reduced
%  subset, they look for triangles whose u is properly bounded. In the
%  greatly reduced subset, the look for triangles whose v is properly
%  bounded. The finally apply the division to get the units correct.

% if the determinant is (almost) zero, then the
%  ray is passing (almost) parallel to the surface of the
%  triangle. So there is (almost) no intersection.

% The ray has a direction. If the direction of the ray hits
%  the backside of the triangle, then the ray and the triangle
%  are both pointing in the same direction, and we say that
%  the triangle is passing from the inside to the outside or
%  backside to frontside.
% If the ray is pointing in the opposite direction, then
%  the ray is passing from the outside to the inside (frontside
%  to backside).

%  If the determinant is negative, then we are passing through
%  the backside of the triangle. If positive, then the
%  frontside.
