% TESS_SCOUT_SWELL: Enlarge a patch by appending the next set of adjacent vertices.
%
% USAGE:  newverts = tess_scout_swell(iverts, vconn);
%
% INPUT:
%     - iverts : index list of vertex numbers
%     - vconn  : sparse matrix of vertex connectivity
% OUTPUT:
%     - newverts: row vec list of NEW vertex numbers adjacent the patch
