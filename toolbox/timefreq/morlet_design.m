function [f, FWHM_t, FWHM_f, t, W] = morlet_design(fc,FWHM_tc)
% MORLET_DESIGN: Plots the complex Morlet wavelet and its temporal and frequency resolution for a set of frequencies.
%
% USAGE:  [f, FWHM_t, FWHM_f, t, W] = morlet_design(fc,FWHM_tc)
%
% INPUTS:
%     - fc      : Central frequency
%     - FWHM_tc : Full width half maximum of Gaussian kernel (in time) at the central
%                 frequency decreasing FWHM_tc improves temporal resolution (because
%                 the wavelet has smaller temporal extent) at the expense of frequency resolution
%
% DESCRIPTION: 
%     The complex Morlet wavelet is a Gaussian weighted sinusoid, blue for real values,
%     red for imaginary values. The wavelet has temporal and frequency resolution
%     weighted by Gaussian kernels. Two standard deviations are defined to be the resolution in
%     either dimension. 
%
% EXAMPLES: 
%     fc = 1;
%     FWHM_tc = 3;
%     morlet_design(fc,FWHM_tc);
