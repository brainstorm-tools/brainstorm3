function W = morlet_wavelet(t,fc,sigma_tc)
% MORLET_WAVELET: Returns the complex Morlet wavelet for a specified central frequency and
%
% USAGE:  W = morlet_wavelet(t,fc,sigma_tc)
%
% INPUTS:
%    - t       : timepoints where the wavelet will be calculated
%    - fc      : central frequency
%    - sigma_tc: standard deviation of Gaussian kernel in time at the central
%                frequency. Decreasing sigma_tc improves temporal resolution (because
%                the wavelet has smaller temporal extent) at the expense of frequency
%                resolution
%
% Example values:
%    fc = 1;
%    sigma_tc = 1.5;
