function [fileList, iFilter] = file_select( DialogType, WindowTitle, DefaultFile, Filters )
% FILE_SELECT: File selection based on Matlab functions only. 
%
% WARNING: In general, java_getfile should be used instead of file_select.
%          However, in some specific cases, java_getfile would freeze Matlab,
%          and this function can be used as a cheap replacement.
%
% INPUT:
%    - DialogType    : {'open', 'save'}
%    - WindowTitle   : String
%    - DefaultFile   : To ignore, set to []
%    - Filters       : {NbFilters x 2} cell array
%                      Filters(i,:) = {{'.ext1', '.ext2', '_tag1'...}, Description}
%
% OUTPUT:
%    - fileList : Cell-array of strings, full paths to the files that were selected
%    - iFilter  : Index of the file filter that was used when selecting the files
