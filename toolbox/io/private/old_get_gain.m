function A = old_get_gain(fid,ndx)
% GET_GAIN: Get a set of source foward fields from a .bin gain matrix file.
%
% USAGE:  A = old_get_gain(fid,ndx);
%
% INPUT:
%    - fid : a file identifier following a fopen call on a valid binary gain matrix file
%    - ndx : vector array of source indices for which the forward fields are requested
% OUTPUT:
%    - A   : array of requested forward fields
%
% NOTES:
%    - The user is responsible for opening the file in the proper machine format.
%    - For head model matrices, this routine should only be accessed from read_gain,
%      so that a consistent machine format is used to read the file.
