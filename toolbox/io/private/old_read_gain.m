function G = old_read_gain(FILENAME,chanID,srcID)
% READ_GAIN: Extract parts or a compete gain matrix from .bin binay gain file.
%
% USAGE:  G = old_read_gain(FILENAME,chanID,srcID);
%
% INPUT:
%    - FILENAME: A character string describing the name of the file containing the matrix 
%                The gain matrix file must be in the Brainstorm binary file format.
%    - chanID  : Optional vector of indices linked to the ROWS of the matrix (ie channels) to be extracted 
%                If chanID is LEFT EMPTY, the matrix is extracted for all channels
%    - srcID   : Optional vector of indices linked to the COLUMNS of the matrix to be extracted 
%                If srcID is LEFT EMPTY, matrix is extracted for all sources
% OUTPUT:
%    - G       : an array containing the forward fields of the gain (sub)matrix.
