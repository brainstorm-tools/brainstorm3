function out_fwrite_spm(sFile, SamplesBounds, iChannels, F)
% OUT_FWRITE_SPM: Write a block of data in SPM binary file (.dat).
%
% USAGE:  out_fwrite_spm(sFile, SamplesBounds=[All], iChannels=[All], F)
%
% INPUTS:
%     - sFile         : Structure for importing files in Brainstorm. Created by in_fopen()
%     - SamplesBounds : [smpStart smpStop], First and last sample to read
%                       Set to [] to specify all the time definition
%     - iChannels     : Indices of the channels to write
%                       Set to [] to specify all the channels
%     - F             : Block of data to write to the file [iChannels x SamplesBounds]
