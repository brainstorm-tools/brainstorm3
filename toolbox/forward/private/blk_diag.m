function bd = blk_diag(A,n)
%BLK_DIAG Make or extract a sparse block diagonal matrix
% function bd = blk_diag(A,n);
% If A is not sparse, then
% returns a sparse block diagonal "bd", diagonalized from the
% elements in "A".
% "A" is ma x na, comprising bdn=(na/"n") blocks of submatrices.
% Each submatrix is ma x "n", and these submatrices are
% placed down the diagonal of the matrix.
%
% If A is already sparse, then the operation is reversed, yielding a block
% row matrix, where each set of n columns corresponds to a block element
% from the block diagonal.
%
% Routine uses NO for-loops for speed considerations.
