%     source_grid(sensor_r,source_maxr,source_minr,Factor,STATS,VERBOSE);
% Given the scalar radius to the sensors sensor_r, 
%  the maximum scalar radius to the sources source_rmax, 
%  the minimum scalar radius to the sources source_rmin,
%  then generate possible dipole source locations L in the upper hemisphere.
% 
% Optional Factor is the fraction considered significant, default 0.1;
% Optional STATS flag means prepend stats onto the first rows of L
% Optional VERBOSE flag means describe the results.
% Optional [L1,L2,L3,...,L9] = source_grid(...
%  generate higher order expansion points.
%
% If(STATS), then in each location matrix, 
%  L(1) give the number of surfaces used, 
%  L(2,:) to L(L(1)+1,:) are statistics.  The first column of the statistics
%  rows gives the radial distance of the surface, the second column gives
%  the spacing used on that surface, and the third gives the number of
%  source points assigned on that surface.  Thus delete L(1:(L(1)+1),:) 
%  after viewing or extracting the statistics.

  % Theory is that an uncovered source is min_d from the nearest sensor.  We

  % sufficient coverage.  The radius of coverage is such that two
  % intersecting circles intersect such that the radius by distance is still
  % equivalent to the Factor.  So radius of coverage = Factor *
  % (min_d+offset). Spacing = sqrt(2)*radius of coverage. Interlace
