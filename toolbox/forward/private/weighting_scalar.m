function sc = weighting_scalar(Loc,Orient,Weight,Vertices,VertNormals)
% WEIGHTING_SCALAR: For use with Overlapping Sphere.
%
% USAGE:  sc = weighting_scalar(Loc,Orient,Weight,Vertices,VertNormals);
%
% INPUT: (Unchecked for speed)
%    - Loc      : 3 x n
%    - Orient   : 3 x n or null
%    - Weight   : length n
%    - Vertices     : N x 3
%    - VertNormals  : N x 3
%
% DESCRIPTION:
% Given a single location and optional orientation, calculate the weighting function
%  to each vertex, using it's corresponding normal.
% Let d = Loc - Vertex, d3 = abs(d)^3, calculate for each vertex in Vertices.
% Let n be the normal pointing vector at each vertex
% If orientation is given, assume MEG case, then replace n with Orient cross n.
% Then
%  sc = n dot d/d3.
% Repeat for each location in Loc, summing by the corresponding scalar in Weight
