function Sphere = bst_os(Channel, Vertices, Faces)
% BST_OS: Create overlapping spheres for EEG/MEG channels.
%
% USAGE:  Sphere = bst_os(Channel, Vertices, Faces)
% 
% INPUT: 
%     - Channel[]:  an array of structures.
%         |- Loc     : a matrix of locations of the sensor coil centers, one column per coil
%         |- Orient  : corresponding matrix of orientations, null in the case of EEG
%         |- Weight  : relative weights to each coil. Used here in the least-squares (default is 1).
%         |- Type    : 'MEG','MEG MAG','MEG GRAD','EEG'
%         |- Comment : unused here.
%     - Vertices   : Mx3 double matrix
%     - Faces      : Nx3 double matrix
%
% OUTPUT:
%    - Sphere[]: array of structures (one per channel)
%         |- Center : a 3 x 1 center location and 
%         |- Radius : the corresponding radius.
%         |- Weight : a weighting vector for coloring the vertices to indicate
%         |           the relative surface weights.
%         |- Approx : the identified surface weights on the sphere.
%
% NOTES: - Sphere.Center and Sphere.Radius should be transferred to fields in the 
%          structure HeadModel.Param
