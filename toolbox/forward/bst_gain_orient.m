% BST_GAIN_ORIENT: Constrain source orientation on a leadfield matrix
%
% USAGE:  Gain = bst_gain_orient(Gain, GridOrient, GridAtlas)
%
% INPUT: 
%     - Gain       : [nChannels,3*nSources] leadfield matrix
%     - GridOrient : [nSources,3] orientation for each source of the Gain matrix
% OUTPUT:
%     - Gain : [nChannels,nSources] leadfield matrix with fixed orientations
