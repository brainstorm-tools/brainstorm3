function idxTrials = bst_trial_idx(idx, nTimes, nTrials)
% BST_TRIAL_IDX         Given the indices of desired time points for one trial,
%                       form a list of indices that pulls those time points
%                       from each trial in a concatenated set of trials.
%
% INPUTS:
%  idx        - Desired time samples in each trial
%               1 <= min(idx) and max(idx) <= nTimes
%  nTimes     - Length of each trial
%  nTrials    - Number of trials
%
% OUTPUT:
%  idxTrials 	- Indices to pull time samples from all trials.
%
% Given a matrix of concatenated trials
%   y = [y_1(1) ... y_1(nTimes) y_2(1) ... y_nTrials(1) ... y_nTrials(nTimes)]
% we want to pull out y_i(idx) for each trial i. We do that by calling
%   desired = y(bst_trial_idx(idx, nTimes, nTrials))
% to get
%   [y_1(idx) y_2(idx) ... y_nTrials(idx)]
%
% Call:
%   idxTrials = bst_trial_idx(idx, nTimes, nTrials)
