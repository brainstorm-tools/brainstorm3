function [R, pValues] = bst_corrn(X, Y, RemoveMean)
% BST_CORRN: Calculates the same correlation coefficients as Matlab function corrcoef (+/- rounding errors), but in a vectorized way
%            Equivalent to bst_correlation with nDelay=1 and maxDelay=0 
%
% INPUTS:
%    - X: [Nx,Nt], Nx signals varying in time
%    - Y: [Ny,Nt], Ny signals varying in time
%    - RemoveMean: If 1, removes the average of the signal before calculating the correlation
%                  If 0, computes a scalar product instead of a correlation
%
% NOTE: The rounding errors
%    Corrcoef computes the correlation coefficients based on the variance values computed with cov(),
%    instead of a direct sum of the squared values (sum(Xc.^2,2)).
%    Hence it uses a corrected algorithm for the computation of the variance, that is not sensible to
%    the rounding errors for large number of time samples. We do not divide the values by the number 
%    of samples here, so if the two signals are the same range of dynamics, those rounding errors
%    should not be a problem, even for a very large number of time samples.
