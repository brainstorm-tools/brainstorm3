# Brainstorm
Brainstorm is a collaborative, open-source application dedicated to the analysis of brain recordings:
MEG, EEG, fNIRS, ECoG, depth electrodes and animal electrophysiology.

Our objective is to share a comprehensive set of user-friendly tools with the scientific community using MEG/EEG as an experimental technique. For physicians and researchers, the main advantage of Brainstorm is its rich and intuitive graphic interface, which does not require any programming knowledge. We are also putting the emphasis on practical aspects of data analysis (e.g., with scripting for batch analysis and intuitive design of analysis pipelines) to promote reproducibility and productivity in MEG/EEG research. Finally, although Brainstorm is developed with Matlab (and Java), it does not require users to own a Matlab license: an executable, platform-independent (Windows, MacOS, Linux) version is made available in the downloadable package. To get an overview of the interface, you can watch this [introduction video](http://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Screenshots).

Since the project started by the end of the 1990's, our server has registered more than 25,000 accounts. See our [reference page](http://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Pub) for a list of published studies featuring Brainstorm at work.

The best way to learn how to use Brainstorm, like any other academic software, is to benefit from local experts. However, you may be the first one in your institution to consider using Brainstorm for your research. We are happy to provide comprehensive [online tutorials](http://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Tutorials) and support through our forum but there is nothing better than a course to make your learning curve steeper. Consult our [training pages](http://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Training) for upcoming opportunities to learn better and faster.

Finally, have a look regularly at our [What's new](http://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/News) page for staying on top of Brainstorm news and updates and [Like us on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/brainstormsoftware) to stay in touch. We hope you enjoy using Brainstorm as much as we enjoy developing and sharing these tools with the community!
