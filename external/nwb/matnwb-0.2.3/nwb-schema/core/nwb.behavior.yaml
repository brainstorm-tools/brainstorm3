  doc: TimeSeries for storing behavioral epochs.  The objective of this and the other
    two Behavioral interfaces (e.g. BehavioralEvents and BehavioralTimeSeries) is
    to provide generic hooks for software tools/scripts. This allows a tool/script
    to take the output one specific interface (e.g., UnitTimes) and plot that data
    relative to another data modality (e.g., behavioral events) without having to
    define all possible modalities in advance. Declaring one of these interfaces means
    that one or more TimeSeries of the specified type is published. These TimeSeries
    should reside in a group having the same name as the interface. For example, if
    a BehavioralTimeSeries interface is declared, the module will have one or more
    TimeSeries defined in the module sub-group 'BehavioralTimeSeries'. BehavioralEpochs
    should use IntervalSeries. BehavioralEvents is used for irregular events. BehavioralTimeSeries
    is for continuous data.
