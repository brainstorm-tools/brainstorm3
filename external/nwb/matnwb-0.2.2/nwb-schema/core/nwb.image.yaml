  doc: General image data that is common between acquisition and stimulus time series.
    Sometimes the image data is stored in the file in a raw format while other
    times it will be stored as a series of external image files in the host file system.
    The data field will either be binary data, if the data is stored in the NWB file, or
    empty, if the data is stored in an external image stack. [frame][x][y] or [frame][x][y][z].

      This is only relevant if the image series is stored in the file system as one

      in another NWB file and that file is linked to this file.

      shape:

      doc: Each external image may contain one or more consecutive frames of the full
        ImageSeries. This attribute serves as an index to indicate which frames each file
        contains, to faciliate random access. The 'starting_frame' attribute, hence,
        contains a list of frame numbers within the full ImageSeries of the first frame
        of each file listed in the parent 'external_file' dataset. Zero-based indexing is
        used (hence, the first element will always be zero). For example, if the
        'external_file' dataset has three paths to files and the first file has 5 frames,
        the second file has 10 frames, and the third file has 20 frames, then this
        attribute will have values [0, 5, 15]. If there is a single external file that
        holds all of the frames of the ImageSeries (and so there is a single element in
        the 'external_file' dataset), then this attribute should have value [0].
  - name: format

    doc: Format of image. If this is 'external', then the attribute 'external_file'
      contains the path information to the image files. If this is 'raw', then the raw
      (single-channel) binary data is stored in the 'data' dataset. If this attribute
      is not present, then the default format='raw' case is assumed.

- neurodata_type_def: ImageMaskSeries
  neurodata_type_inc: ImageSeries
  doc: An alpha mask that is applied to a presented visual stimulus. The 'data' array
    contains an array of mask values that are applied to the displayed image. Mask
    values are stored as RGBA. Mask can vary with time. The timestamps array indicates
    the starting time of a mask, and that mask pattern continues until it's explicitly
    changed.

- neurodata_type_def: OpticalSeries
  neurodata_type_inc: ImageSeries
  doc: Image data that is presented or recorded. A stimulus template movie will be
    stored only as an image. When the image is presented as stimulus, additional data
    is required, such as field of view (e.g., how much of the visual field the image
    covers, or how what is the area of the target being imaged). If the OpticalSeries
    represents acquired imaging data, orientation is also important.

- neurodata_type_def: IndexSeries
  neurodata_type_inc: TimeSeries
  doc: Stores indices to image frames stored in an ImageSeries. The purpose of the
    ImageIndexSeries is to allow a static image stack to be stored somewhere, and
    the images in the stack to be referenced out-of-order. This can be for the display
    of individual images, or of movie segments (as a movie is simply a series of images).
    The data field stores the index of the frame in the referenced ImageSeries, and
    the timestamps array indicates when that image was displayed.
