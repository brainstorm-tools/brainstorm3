        If the data are stored in acquisition system units or other units

        to convert the data to the specified 'unit'. e.g. if the data acquisition system
        stores values in this object as signed 16-bit integers (int16 range
        -32,768 to 32,767) that correspond to a 5V range (-2.5V to 2.5V), and the data
        acquisition system gain is 8000X, then the 'conversion' multiplier to get from
        raw data acquisition values to recorded volts is 2.5/32768/8000 = 9.5367e-9.
