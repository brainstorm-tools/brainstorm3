Summary: Bug fixes related to Matlab throwing errors when it shouldn't have been. Thanks to Shane Lin for pointing out the problems.

Bug Fix: Modified code so that http status errors wouldn't throw errors in the code, but rather would be passed on to the user to process

Bug Fix: Provided GET example code apparently doesn't work for all users, changed to a different example.
