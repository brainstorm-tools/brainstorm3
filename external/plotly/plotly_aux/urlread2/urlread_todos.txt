                            IMPROVEMENTS
==========================================================================
1) The function could be improved to support file streaming both in sending
and in receiving (saving) to reduce memory usage but this is very low priority

2) Implement better casing handling

3) Choose a better function name than urlread2 -> sorry Chris :)

4) Support multipart/form-data, this ideally would be handled by a helper function

5) Allow for throwing an error if the HTTP status code is an error (400) and 500 as well?
