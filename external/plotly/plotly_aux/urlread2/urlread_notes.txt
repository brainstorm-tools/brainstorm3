                            Unicode & Matlab
==========================================================================
native2unicode - works with uint8, fails with char

Taking a unicode character and encoding as bytes:
unicode2native(char(1002),'UTF-8')
back to the character:
native2unicode(uint8([207  170]),'UTF-8')
this doesn't work:
native2unicode(char([207  170]),'UTF-8')
in documentation: If BYTES is a CHAR vector, it is returned unchanged.

Java - only supports int8
Matlab to Java -> uint8 or int8 to bytes
Java to Matlab -> bytes to int8
char - 16 bit

Maintenance of underlying bytes:
typecast(java.lang.String(uint8(250)).getBytes,'uint8') = 250
see documentation: Handling Data Returned from a Java Method

Command Window difficulty
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The typical font in the Matlab command window will often fail to render
unicode properly. I often can see unicode better in the variable editor
although this may be fixed if you change your font preferences ...
Copying unicode from the command window often results in the
generations of the value 26 (aka substitute)

More documentation on input/output to urlread2 to follow eventually ...

small notes to self:
for output
native2unicode(uint8(output),encoding)

                              HTTP Headers
==========================================================================
Handling of repeated http readers is a bit of a tricky situation. Most 
headers are not repeated although sometimes http clients will assume this 
for too many headers which can result in a problem if you want to see
duplicated headers. I've passed the problem onto the user who can decide
to handle it how they wish instead of providing the right solution, which 
after some brief searching, I am not sure exists.

                               PROBLEMS
==========================================================================
1) Page requires following a redirect:
%-------------------------------------------
ref: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/newsreader/view_thread/302571
fix: FOLLOW_REDIRECTS is enabled by default, you're fine.

2) Basic authentication required:
%------------------------------------------
Create and pass in the following header:
user     = 'test';
password = 'test';
encoder  = sun.misc.BASE64Encoder();
str      = java.lang.String([user ':' password]) %NOTE: format may be
%different for your server
header   = http_createHeader('Authorization',char(encoder.encode(str.getBytes())))
NOTE: Ideally you would make this a function

3) The text returned doesn't make sense.
%-----------------------------------------
The text may not be encoded correctly. Requires native2unicode function.
See Unicode & Matlab section above.

4) I get a different result in my web browser than I do in Matlab
%-----------------------------------------
This is generally seen for two reasons. 
1 - The easiest and silly reason is user agent filtering. 
When you make a request you identify yourself
as being a particular "broswer" or "user agent". Setting a header
with the user agent of the browser may fix the problem.
See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent
See: http://whatsmyuseragent.com
value = ''
header = http_createHeader('User-Agent',value);
2 - You are not processing cookies and the server is not sending
you information because you haven't sent it cookies (everyone likes em!)
I've implemented cookie support but it requires some extra files that
I need to clean up. Feel free to email me if you'd really like to have them.
