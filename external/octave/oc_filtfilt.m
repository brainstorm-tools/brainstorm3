% @deftypefn {Function File} {@var{y} =} filtfilt (@var{b}, @var{a}, @var{x})
%
% Forward and reverse filter the signal. This corrects for phase
% distortion introduced by a one-pass filter, though it does square the
% magnitude response in the process. That's the theory at least.  In
% practice the phase correction is not perfect, and magnitude response
% is distorted, particularly in the stop band.
%
% Example
% @example
% @group
% [b, a]=butter(3, 0.1);                  % 5 Hz low-pass filter
% t = 0:0.01:1.0;                         % 1 second sample
% x=sin(2*pi*t*2.3)+0.25*randn(size(t));  % 2.3 Hz sinusoid+noise
% y = filtfilt(b,a,x); z = filter(b,a,x); % apply filter
% plot(t,x,';data;',t,y,';filtfilt;',t,z,';filter;')
% @end group
% @end example
% @end deftypefn

% FIXME: My version seems to have similar quality to matlab,
%        but both are pretty bad.  They do remove gross lag errors, though.
